Hi, my name is Philipp aka cmplx

i am a trained Computer Science Expert with main emphasis on Software Development.<br>
i live in Germany and work for a Company that delivers Medical Software around the globe.<br>
i'm still in my 20ies, love Cars and Partying with my friends. oh and of course i love creating cursed software :)

i have learned to program pretty early in my life, i started around the age of 13 with minecraft modding (of course) so after a couple of years i got pretty seasoned in Java. after that i got into the game hacking and reverse engineering scene, where i wrote my first hacks for GTA5 Money (i dont condone or endorse cheating against other players, i just dont wanna pay 50 bucks for a shark card) in C# out of all languages. I've leared pretty early about the lower levels of computing, memory safety and access which is why the switch to C and C++ was pretty easy when we started getting classes about it in school. after finishing school i started doing react web development combined with more and more backend stuff in node and php unti i pretty much was a full-stack dev at my company. now i also cosplay as sysadmin and do network management/administration stuff aswell

nowadays i try to learn as much as i possibly can and try to grasp advanced concepts like compiler design, kernelwriting, drivers etc.<br>
i am now also pretty much comfortable reading and writing a lot of programming languages (but as any programmer will tell you they are all basically same same :D )

and yeah thats mostly all about my persona
